Let's go to revisions:
$ cd revisions/01_04_playbooks_introduction/

Let's go to the first version:
$ cd 01
This is a pattern for playbooks

---
# YAML documents begin with document seperator ---

# The minus in YAML indicates a list of items. The playbook contains a list
# of plays, with each play being a dictionary
- 

    # Target: where our play will run and options it will run with
    
    # Variable: variables that will apply to the play, on all target systems

    # Task: The list of tasks that will be executed within the play, this section
    # can also be used for pre and post tasks

    # Handlers: handlers that are executed as a notify key from a task

    # Roles: list of roles to be imported into the play

# Three dots indicate the end of YAML document
...

Next version:
$ cd ../02

in ansible.cfg file if nocow = True will be omitted then information will be shown as cow say

In motd_playbook.yaml

    # Target: where our play will run and options it will run with

    # Task: The list of tasks that will be executed within the play, this section

    task:
        - name: Configure a MOTD (Message of the day)
          copy:
            src: centos_motd
            dest: /etc/motd

    # Handlers: handlers that are executed as a notify key from a task

    # Roles: list of roles to be imported into the play

# Three dots indicate the end of YAML document

To run the abovementioned playbook:
$ ansible-playbook motd_playbook.yaml

Let's go to next version:
$ cd ../03
$ cat motd_playbook.yaml

    # Handlers: handlers that are executed as a notify key from a task

    # Roles: list of roles to be imported into the play

# Three dots indicate the end of YAML document

To run playbook:
$ ansible-playbook motd_playbook.yaml

Gather fact won't run
